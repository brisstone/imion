    title: "ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL MARITIME INSTITUTE OF NIGERIA",
    content_one:
      "The growth of the global maritime industry recognised the need for skilled professionals who can contribute effectively to the development of maritime sector. This led to establishment of specialized institutions, particularly in developed nations, to meet the demand of highly educated maritime experts. Nigeria has a rich maritime heritage with a vast coastline of over 853 kilometres and has long recognised the significance of the maritime sector for its economic development.",
    content_two:
      "The Gulf of Guinea (GoG) with 19 countries is also a major hub for maritime-based exploration and sea trade. This area falls directly in the geographical area of interest of the NN. The NN thus recognized the critical roles which strategy, policy and research play in the development of the maritime industry and the need for a think-tank platform for maritime strategic thinkers, practitioners and allies to interact, share ideas and research into maritime strategic affairs affecting the GoG and beyond.",
    content_three:
      "To address this critical need, the International Maritime Institute of Nigeria (IMION) is established as a think-tank research and policy advocacy institute that would complement government agencies involved in the maritime sector by mobilising maritime experts to assist and support in maritime policy planning and implementation through free exchange of ideas on maritime-related matters.",
    content_four:
      "Specifically, IMION would be focused on topics within broad and specific maritime thematic areas, such as maritime and ocean governance, maritime security and law enforcement, hydrography, blue economy and climate change among others. The model conceptualised for IMION is to be a Quasi-Independent think tank so as to be able to intentionally establish wide engagements and interactions with the global maritime intellectual ecosystem. Accordingly, IMION would collaborate with like-minded partners/institutions within and outside the Nigerian maritime industry to ensure industry relevance and alignment with international standards.
